# scamTokenList
A compilation of known scam tokens

This List contains tokens that are either unsellable or don't allow pulling of Liquidity due to bug (and owners don't provide means to remove)


Currently you can import via github direct link ->  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rachel-Eichenberger/scamTokenList/main/ScamTokenList.json

Does a new list need to be established for LinkMint created official vs. scam tokens?
