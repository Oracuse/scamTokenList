# scamTokenList
A compilation of known scam tokens

This List contains tokens that are either unsellable or don't allow pulling of Liquidity due to bug (and owners don't provide means to remove)


Currently you can import via ens name ->  scamtokenlist.eth
Will be updated as often as possible based on gas
If you want to donate you can donate to the ens address
This will go to cover more updates as gas isn't cheap :)
