# scamTokenList
A compilation of known scam tokens

**__Due to a Y2k style glitch, the token list Will likely need to be reloaded if you had before version 99__**
**__Remove the List and reload current list version today (4-18-22) == 5.42.2 and always growing__**

This List contains tokens that are either unsellable or don't allow pulling of Liquidity due to bug (and owners don't provide means to remove)
if your token is on this list and isn't a scam reach out to me in the uniswap discord

Currently you can import via github direct link ->  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rachel-Eichenberger/scamTokenList/main/ScamTokenList.json
